## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/renusri23/event-calendar.git
   cd event-calendar


2. **Install dependencies for the frontend:**
Install Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from nodejs.org.

Navigate to your project directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and change the directory to the location of your React project. If your project is in a folder named my-react-app, you can navigate to it using:

cd /path/to/my-react-app
 **Install dependencies:** Once you are in the project directory, run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file:

npm install
 **Start the development server:** After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using:

npm start
This will run the start script defined in your package.json file, which uses react-scripts to start the server. The application should open in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

3. **Install depecndencies for backend :**
redirect and come back to main folder (since backend is runned directly through the event-calendarfolder ) to your event-calendar folder 
npm install 
npm start
